      <p>
        Most people try Claude once, get a mediocre result, and go back to writing everything themselves.
        The problem isn't Claude. The problem is that they're using it the way they'd use a search engine — one vague question, one shot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Writing with Claude isn't about magic prompts. It's about giving Claude what it actually needs: context, a clear job, and your raw material.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Claude is unusually good at writing</h2>
      <p>
        Claude is trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest — but what that actually produces is a model that's unusually good at nuanced, long-form writing. It can hold context across a long document. It adjusts tone when you ask. It doesn't just rephrase — it restructures.
      </p>
      <p>
        For writing tasks, that matters a lot. The difference between a first draft that sounds like you and one that sounds like a bot is usually how much context you gave Claude upfront. (If you want the fundamentals first, start with <a href="/blog/claude-prompting-guide">our prompting guide</a>.)
      </p>

      <h2>The writing workflow that actually works</h2>
      <p>Here's a repeatable workflow you can use for any piece of writing — emails, articles, reports, proposals.</p>

      <h3>Step 1: Dump your raw material</h3>
      <p>
        Don't start by asking Claude to write something. Start by giving it everything you have: rough notes, bullet points, voice memo transcripts, half-sentences, old drafts. Don't clean it up first.
      </p>
      <p>Tell Claude: <em>"Here's my raw material. I want to write [type of piece] for [audience]. Here's everything I have..."</em> then paste it all in.</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Ask for a structure first, not a draft</h3>
      <p>
        Ask Claude to suggest a structure or outline before it writes anything. This gives you a chance to correct the direction before you're looking at 800 words you don't want to edit.
      </p>
      <p>Once the structure looks right, say: <em>"Now write a full draft following this structure."</em></p>

      <h3>Step 3: Refine in passes, not rewrites</h3>
      <p>
        Give Claude specific instructions for each pass: tighten the opening, make the tone less formal, add a stronger call to action at the end. One change at a time works better than asking Claude to fix everything at once.
      </p>

      <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Asking too vaguely.</strong> "Write me a blog post about productivity" gives Claude nothing to work with. Tell it your angle, your audience, and what you actually want to say. Our <a href="/blog/claude-prompts-for-business">business prompt templates</a> show you exactly how.</li>
        <li><strong>Starting from scratch instead of from your material.</strong> Claude is better at shaping what you already have than inventing from nothing.</li>
        <li><strong>Asking for a final draft in one go.</strong> Break it into structure → draft → refinement. You'll get better output and stay in control.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What this looks like in practice</h2>
      <p>
        A consultant I know uses this workflow to write client-facing summaries after every engagement. She pastes her meeting notes and voice memo transcript into Claude, tells it the audience is a senior executive who wasn't in the room, and asks for a structured summary. It takes her 10 minutes instead of 90.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's the point. Claude isn't replacing her judgment or her expertise. It's handling the part that used to eat her time. (For more examples like this, see <a href="/blog/claude-vs-chatgpt-for-writing">why Claude beats ChatGPT for writing</a>.)
